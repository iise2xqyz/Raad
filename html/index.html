		R_aad is the Discord Bot used in only Web-like Company 3. it always-on is accomplished by using a virtual web server and GAS. This Bot is not exactly existing a lot of features, but going to be implement more features in the future.<br>
	 By the way, I say “accomplished by using a virtual web server and GAS” some time ago, How does accomplish always-on specifically?
It is the sneaky way and its way is as follows:
	 <ol>
		 <li>Set up a virtual web server by using the http methods.
		 <li>Send a request every five minutes from GAS.
	 </ol>
	 Wise you have noticed. “Why do you do it indirectly way?”<br>
	 It codes executed by Replit, but its execution time is only 5 minutes when you are a free member. I don’t have enough money, so I am a free member. it can’t accomplish always-on without GAS, so I do it indirectly way.<br>
<br>
	By the way, We are going to do web development, so The purpose of developing this bot is to show an example of a system using javascript for the team member.
	This system uses several important factors in web development such as callback function, setting up a web server, modularization and html/css.
	In learning not only web technology but also all topics, To experience practically is very important.
	But we are not decided on what do we develop specifically, so I must prepare whatever specific example system using JavaScript.
